- loading tweets with pjax?

- ask pat about:
-- search field when managing content
-- dynamic search should update not only the #shows_list but also the tweets area
-- dynamic search field: retain value when focus is off field
-- link to original tweet on twitter?
-- when window is narrow and clicking a show link, window should scroll back up
-- detached view: are the select menus supposed to be chosen fields?
