# Capybara defaults to XPath selectors rather than Webrat's default of CSS3. In
# order to ease the transition to Capybara we set the default here. If you'd
# prefer to use XPath just remove this line and adjust any selectors in your
# steps to use the XPath syntax.

# By default, any exception happening in your Rails application will bubble up
# to Cucumber so that your scenario will fail. This is a different from how 
# your application behaves in the production environment, where an error page will 
# be rendered instead.
#
# Sometimes we want to override this default behaviour and allow Rails to rescue
# exceptions and display an error page (just like when the app is running in production).
# Typical scenarios where you want to do this is when you test your error pages.
# There are two ways to allow Rails to rescue exceptions:
#
# 1) Tag your scenario (or feature) with @allow-rescue
#
# 2) Set the value below to true. Beware that doing this globally is not
# recommended as it will mask a lot of errors for you!
#
ActionController::Base.allow_rescue = false

# If you set this to true, each scenario will run in a database transaction.
# You can still turn off transactions on a per-scenario basis, simply tagging 
# a feature or scenario with the @no-txn tag. If you are using Capybara,
# tagging with @culerity or @javascript will also turn transactions off.
#
# If you set this to false, transactions will be off for all scenarios,
# regardless of whether you use @no-txn or not.
#
# Beware that turning transactions off will leave data in your database 
# after each scenario, which can lead to hard-to-debug failures in 
# subsequent scenarios. If you do this, we recommend you create a Before
# block that will explicitly put your database in a known state.
Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = true

# How to clean your database when transactions are turned off. See
